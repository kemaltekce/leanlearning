      <description>Learning happens in a state of focus and being comfortable with frustration. This duo triggers the neurochemical cocktail needed for learning which consists of Acetylcholine, Epinephrine and Dopamine.&#xA;Focusing means paying attention and being alert at the same time. Paying attention releases Acetylcholine which helps with your focus. Being alert, on the other hand, releases Epinephrine which reduces anxiety and gives you the energy to learn.&#xA;To support your focus and the release of Acetylcholine, define what you want to learn and why you want to learn it.</description>

      <description>After going through the mindset for learning, it&amp;rsquo;s now time to talk about the place to learn. A place where you can collect materials, plan your learning and actually learn. It can be fun and adventurous to research and adjust your learning system. But it also bears a trap. Constantly adjusting your learning system and searching for the perfect setup can get annoying and frustrating. You might spend more time looking for the perfect system than actually learning.</description>

      <title>the three learning phases</title>
      <link>https://kmltkc.de/leanlearning/learning/10_three_phases_of_learning.html</link>

      <description>Learning is more than just sitting down and starting to study. Learning has three phases which repeat themself and can even intertwin. These three phases are priming, studying and practising.&#xA;priming Priming aims to get an abstract and rough idea about a topic. No details. You skim, explore and try to understand the connection of abstract concepts. You just worry about the big picture and ignore all the details. The details will come later in the studying phase.</description>

      <description>Learning helps you expand your knowledge, follow your curiosities and adapt to new circumstances. But learning takes time and effort. During school and university, it was easier to learn. You had time. You had a curriculum to follow. You had deadlines for tests. Everything was prepared for you.&#xA;But it&amp;rsquo;s more difficult to learn while you are working or if you want to learn something new on the side.&#xA;The desire and curiosity to learn are there but you might only have limited time during the day.</description>

      <title>methods to improve focus - time-based technique</title>
      <link>https://kmltkc.de/leanlearning/mindset/20_focus_time_methods.html</link>

      <description>Besides embracing frustration, the other important part of learning is focusing. But our focus can be fragile and we can get easily distracted. Be it through external things like our phones or internal events like thoughts and feelings.&#xA;Additionally, our focus depends on many variables. It depends on how we sleep at night, the time of day, what we eat, our emotional state, our stress level, our energy level, and so on.</description>

      <title>mind mapping</title>
      <link>https://kmltkc.de/leanlearning/learning/20_mind_mapping.html</link>

      <description>The foundational learning technique of LeLe is mind mapping. It is used in all three phases of learning - priming, studying and even practising if you are trying to learn information. But how do we mind map?&#xA;define focus question Start your mind map by defining a focus question. A question you want to answer inside your mind map. Depending on your questions your mind map might look different. Additionally, a focus question can help you focus on something specific and avoid bigger detours into different areas and topics.</description>

      <title>take time for learning</title>
      <link>https://kmltkc.de/leanlearning/place/20_take_time_for_learning.html</link>

      <guid>https://kmltkc.de/leanlearning/place/20_take_time_for_learning.html</guid>
      <description>After having a place to learn, we now need to find the time to learn. Or more accurately, we have to take the time to learn. We may avoid learning by letting random tasks creep into our schedule. We might also hope that magically a time slot will appear in which we can learn. We don&amp;rsquo;t plan for it. We let it to chance. And finally, we get annoyed because we never find the time to learn.</description>

      <title>what is the LeLe method?</title>
      <link>https://kmltkc.de/leanlearning/introduction/20_what_is_lele.html</link>

      <description>Learning can be annoying. There are too many interesting topics, it can get frustrating and you can fall into the trap of shallow learning - keeping yourself entertained without actually learning anything.&#xA;To solve this problem the LeLe method aims to make learning intentional, enjoyable and forgiving.&#xA;It makes learning intentional so that you can find the time to learn and focus on what you want to learn. Thereby, one goal is to constrain curiosities so that you are not dragged around from one interesting topic to the next.</description>

      <title>methods to improve focus - mind-based techniques</title>
      <link>https://kmltkc.de/leanlearning/mindset/30_focus_mind_methods.html</link>

      <guid>https://kmltkc.de/leanlearning/mindset/30_focus_mind_methods.html</guid>
      <description>In addition to the time-based technique, there are also mind-based techniques to improve your focus. These can be used before and during learning.&#xA;2. dump vague thoughts One thing that can distract us the most are our own thoughts.&#xA;Vague thoughts seem to wait until we want to focus. And then, they start bubbling up. You want to focus but you start thinking about cleaning the kitchen. Or you remember that you wanted to call your parents.</description>

      <title>how to plan your learning</title>
      <link>https://kmltkc.de/leanlearning/place/30_how_to_plan_learning.html</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 20 Dec 2023 12:17:22 +0100</pubDate>
      <guid>https://kmltkc.de/leanlearning/place/30_how_to_plan_learning.html</guid>
      <description>The problem with typical learning plans is that we often make a rigorous plan, we don&amp;rsquo;t define why we want to learn, what we want to learn and we don&amp;rsquo;t include any practice. This results in randomly learning a bit here and there, trying to transcribe and cram everything instead of understanding it. It often also results in giving up on learning alltogether.&#xA;But there might be an alternative to this standard way of planning.</description>

      <title>inspiration for LeLe</title>
      <link>https://kmltkc.de/leanlearning/introduction/30_inspiration_for_lele.html</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 20 Dec 2023 12:17:22 +0100</pubDate>
      <guid>https://kmltkc.de/leanlearning/introduction/30_inspiration_for_lele.html</guid>
      <description>The LeLe method is inspired by a variety of methods and people from the space of productivity and neuroscience. LeLe tries to combine those diverse ideas into one coherent learning framework.&#xA;So, special thanks go out to Ryan Carroll and Bullet Journal Method, Andrew Hubermann and the Hubermann Lab Podcast, Justin Sung and his insights into learning and Ryan Singer and his Shape Up method.&#xA;The Bullet Journal Method inspired the LeLe method to be intentional and less distracting.</description>

      <title>iterative learning</title>
      <link>https://kmltkc.de/leanlearning/learning/30_iterative_learning.html</link>

      <guid>https://kmltkc.de/leanlearning/learning/30_iterative_learning.html</guid>
      <description>Learning is not about sitting down and studying once. Learning is not about understanding it perfectly immediately. Learning is about constant iteration. You build up your understanding step by step correcting your mistakes and misunderstandings along the way.&#xA;Iterative learning so powerful because learning is recursive and excursive. Recursive meaning: you have to rethink, re-understanding and re-practice to find gaps and questions in your understanding. Excursive because your learning journey is not the same as someone else&amp;rsquo;s.</description>

      <title>tldr: learning is supposed to be frustrating</title>
      <link>https://kmltkc.de/leanlearning/mindset/40_tldr_learning_is_frustrating.html</link>

      <description>The flow state is a place where things feel effortless. You know exactly what to do and you can do it. But learning doesn’t feel effortless. In fact it often isn&amp;rsquo;t. You have to explore, try to understand and rethink concepts all the time. And, most probably, you will make mistakes.&#xA;Learning is challenging. And sadly there is no hack.&#xA;So instead of flowing, learning feels frustrating.&#xA;But frustration has a bad reputation.</description>

      <title>iterative mind mapping to overcome emotions</title>
      <link>https://kmltkc.de/leanlearning/learning/40_iterative_mapping_emotions.html</link>

      <description>The iterative mind mapping technique is not only great because of its learning capabilities but also because of its beauty in dealing with emotions. It can help you overcome motivation, feeling overwhelmed and the fear of not getting it right.&#xA;no motivation There are times when you are motivated and can jump right into learning. But there are also times of no motivation. It is difficult to sit down and start learning if you have no motivation.</description>

      <title>scattered and shaped learning</title>
      <link>https://kmltkc.de/leanlearning/place/40_scattered_vs_shaped_learning.html</link>

      <description>Up until now, we only discussed shaped/planned learning inside the LAMA+N system. The main idea here is to collect materials and assemble them into a learning unit. You can even shape multiple learnings and deliberately decide what to focus on and what to ignore.&#xA;Besides taking time to plan a whole learning, there are also moments in which you want to learn immediately. You stumble across an interesting article or video with intriguing insights.</description>

      <title>play as a portal to learning</title>
      <link>https://kmltkc.de/leanlearning/mindset/50_play_as_protal_to_learning.html</link>

      <description>Most of us think of games when we hear playing. But playing is not just about games. Playing has important traits that can be used as a portal to learning. Playing helps you tap into focus and embrace frustration - two important learning components.&#xA;We played more when we were younger. We played and explored without overthinking. Everything was a huge experiment for us, and we tried, failed, and learned. But this changed while growing up.</description>

      <title>prime by making a M.E.S.S.</title>
      <link>https://kmltkc.de/leanlearning/learning/50_priming_mess.html</link>

      <guid>https://kmltkc.de/leanlearning/learning/50_priming_mess.html</guid>
      <description>The goal of priming is to get an abstract and rough idea about a topic. A big picture overview. It has to be abstract. Ignore the details otherwise you will get lost in them.&#xA;The idea is to get your mind thinking, start having questions and awaken your curiosity. The LeLe method allows you to prime by making a M.E.S.S. - map, explore, skim and self-explain.&#xA;map Map out your thoughts.</description>

      <title>the power of pause</title>
      <link>https://kmltkc.de/leanlearning/mindset/60_power_of_pause.html</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 20 Dec 2023 15:08:17 +0100</pubDate>
      <guid>https://kmltkc.de/leanlearning/mindset/60_power_of_pause.html</guid>
      <description>Until now, we have emphasised the importance of focusing and embracing frustration. But learning has two stages. One of them is focus and frustration. The other one is rest. Resting is important for learning.&#xA;Learning is associated with changes in your brain. But the changes in your brain actually don&amp;rsquo;t happen while you are learning. They happen at rest.&#xA;The focus and frustration stage is just a highlighter. Neurotransmitters released during learning just highlight areas in your brain which are relevant to what you are learning.</description>

      <title>S.I.M.P. method for learning</title>
      <link>https://kmltkc.de/leanlearning/learning/60_learning_simp.html</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 20 Dec 2023 12:17:22 +0100</pubDate>
      <guid>https://kmltkc.de/leanlearning/learning/60_learning_simp.html</guid>
      <description>The next phase of learning is studying and for this we can use the S.I.M.P. method. This also incorporates the iterative mapping approach from before.&#xA;The S.I.M.P. method stands for&#xA;self-explaining iterating mapping pausing and all of them should be used while studying.&#xA;self-explain Self-explain what you are trying to learn. Skim, read, or watch what you are trying to learn. But rather than transcribing what you consume, explain it to yourself.</description>

      <title>practice makes perfect</title>
      <link>https://kmltkc.de/leanlearning/learning/70_practice_perfect.html</link>

      <guid>https://kmltkc.de/leanlearning/learning/70_practice_perfect.html</guid>
      <description>After priming and studying, the final phase of learning is practising. Through practice and repetition, we can internalise what we are learning and build expertise and knowledge. Practice makes perfect.&#xA;But how should we practice?&#xA;It really depends on what you are trying to learn. Most of the time you will hear advice like &amp;ldquo;learn by building a project&amp;rdquo; which is good advice. The LeLe method recommends it too. But not everything we learn can be connected to a project.</description>
