      <description>Learning happens in a state of focus and being comfortable with frustration. This duo triggers the neurochemical cocktail needed for learning which consists of Acetylcholine, Epinephrine and Dopamine.&#xA;But how are these neuromodulators connected to focus and frustration?&#xA;Focusing means paying attention and being alert at the same time. Paying attention releases Acetylcholine which helps with your focus. Being alert, on the other hand, releases Epinephrine which reduces anxiety and gives you the energy to learn.</description>

      <description>After going through the mindset for learning, it&amp;rsquo;s now time to talk about a place to learn. A place where you can collect materials, plan your learning and actually learn. It can be fun and adventurous to research and adjust your learning system. But it also bears a trap. A trap in which you never start learning but constantly look for a perfect system. Adjusting your learning system and searching for the perfect setup can get annoying and frustrating.</description>

      <title>the three learning phases</title>
      <link>https://kmltkc.de/leanlearning/learning/10_three_phases_of_learning.html</link>

      <description>Learning is more than just sitting down and starting to study. Learning has three phases that repeat themselves and can even intertwine. These three phases are priming, studying, and practising.&#xA;priming The goal of priming is to get an abstract idea about a topic. No details. You skim, explore and try to understand the connection of concepts inside your learning unit. You just worry about the big picture and ignore all the details.</description>

      <description>Learning helps you expand your knowledge, follow your curiosities and adapt to new circumstances. But learning takes time and effort. During school and university, it was easier to learn. You had time. You had a curriculum to follow. You had deadlines for tests. Everything was prepared for you.&#xA;But it&amp;rsquo;s more difficult to learn while you are working.&#xA;You might want to learn about philosophy after work. You might want to improve your communication and writing skills.</description>

      <title>method to improve focus - flexible timeboxing</title>
      <link>https://kmltkc.de/leanlearning/mindset/20_focus_time_methods.html</link>

      <description>Besides embracing frustration, the other important part of learning is focusing. But our focus can be fragile and we can get easily distracted. Be it through external things like our phones or internal events like thoughts and feelings.&#xA;Additionally, our focus depends on many variables. It depends on how we slept the night before, the time of day, what we eat, our emotional state, our stress level, our energy level, and so on.</description>

      <title>mind mapping</title>
      <link>https://kmltkc.de/leanlearning/learning/20_mind_mapping.html</link>

      <description>The main learning technique of LeLe is mind mapping. It is used in all three learning phases - priming, studying and even practising if you are trying to learn information. But how do we mind map?&#xA;define focus question Start your mind map by defining a focus question. A question you want to answer inside your mind map. Depending on your questions your mind map might look different. Additionally, a focus question can help you focus on something specific and avoid bigger detours into different areas and topics.</description>

      <title>take time for learning</title>
      <link>https://kmltkc.de/leanlearning/place/20_take_time_for_learning.html</link>

      <guid>https://kmltkc.de/leanlearning/place/20_take_time_for_learning.html</guid>
      <description>After having a place to learn, we now need to find the time to learn. But that&amp;rsquo;s the problem. Finding time doesn&amp;rsquo;t work. Instead of finding time, we have to take time to learn.&#xA;We may avoid learning by letting random tasks creep into our schedule. We might also hope that magically a time slot will appear in which we can learn. We don&amp;rsquo;t plan for it. We let it to chance.</description>

      <title>what is the LeLe method?</title>
      <link>https://kmltkc.de/leanlearning/introduction/20_what_is_lele.html</link>

      <description>Learning can be annoying. It can get frustrating trying to understand a concept or there might be too many interesting topics to learn or you can even fall into the trap of shallow learning - keeping yourself entertained without actually learning anything.&#xA;To solve these problems, the LeLe method aims to make learning intentional, enjoyable and forgiving.&#xA;intentional It makes learning intentional so that you can find the time to learn and focus on what you want to learn.</description>

      <title>methods to improve focus - mind-based techniques</title>
      <link>https://kmltkc.de/leanlearning/mindset/30_focus_mind_methods.html</link>

      <description>In addition to the time-based technique, there are also mind-based techniques to improve your focus. These can be used before and during learning.&#xA;2. dump vague thoughts One thing that can distract us the most are our own thoughts.&#xA;Vague thoughts seem to wait until we want to focus. And then, they start bubbling up. You want to focus but you start thinking about cleaning the kitchen. Or you remember problems in a project you are working on.</description>

      <title>how to plan your learning</title>
      <link>https://kmltkc.de/leanlearning/place/30_how_to_plan_learning.html</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 20 Dec 2023 12:17:22 +0100</pubDate>
      <guid>https://kmltkc.de/leanlearning/place/30_how_to_plan_learning.html</guid>
      <description>The problem with typical learning plans is that we often make a rigorous plan. We don&amp;rsquo;t define why we want to learn or what we want to learn and we don&amp;rsquo;t include any practice. This results in randomly learning a bit here and there, trying to transcribe and cram as much as possible instead of understanding it. This often leads to giving up on learning altogether.&#xA;But there might be an alternative to this standard way of planning.</description>

      <title>inspiration for LeLe</title>
      <link>https://kmltkc.de/leanlearning/introduction/30_inspiration_for_lele.html</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 20 Dec 2023 12:17:22 +0100</pubDate>
      <guid>https://kmltkc.de/leanlearning/introduction/30_inspiration_for_lele.html</guid>
      <description>The LeLe method is inspired by a variety of ideas and people from the space of productivity and neuroscience. LeLe tries to combine those diverse ideas into one coherent learning framework.&#xA;So, special thanks go out to Ryan Carroll and Bullet Journal Method, Andrew Hubermann and the Hubermann Lab Podcast, Justin Sung and his insights into learning and Ryan Singer and his Shape Up method.&#xA;The Bullet Journal Method inspired the LeLe method to be intentional and less distracting.</description>

      <title>iterative learning</title>
      <link>https://kmltkc.de/leanlearning/learning/30_iterative_learning.html</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 20 Dec 2023 12:17:22 +0100</pubDate>
      <guid>https://kmltkc.de/leanlearning/learning/30_iterative_learning.html</guid>
      <description>Learning is not about sitting down and studying once. Learning is not about understanding it perfectly immediately. Learning is about constant iteration. You build up your understanding step by step correcting your mistakes and misunderstandings along the way.&#xA;Iterative learning is powerful because learning itself is recursive and excursive. Recursive meaning: you have to rethink, re-understanding and re-practice to find gaps and questions in your understanding and correct them. Excursive because your learning journey is not the same as someone else&amp;rsquo;s.</description>

      <title>tldr: learning is supposed to be frustrating</title>

      <description>The flow state is a place where things feel effortless. You know exactly what to do and you can do it. So we often expect learning to be the same. But learning almost never feels effortless. You have to explore, try to understand and rethink concepts all the time. And, most importantly, you will make mistakes. All of which is frustrating.&#xA;Learning is challenging. Learning is frustrating. And sadly there is no hack.</description>

      <title>iterative mind mapping to overcome emotions</title>
      <link>https://kmltkc.de/leanlearning/learning/40_iterative_mapping_emotions.html</link>

      <description>The iterative mind mapping technique is not only great because of its learning capabilities but also because of its beauty in dealing with emotions. It can help you overcome motivation, feeling overwhelmed and the fear of not getting it right.&#xA;no motivation There are times when you are motivated and can jump right into learning. But there are also times of no motivation. It is difficult to sit down and start learning if you have no motivation at all.</description>

      <title>scattered vs shaped learning</title>
      <link>https://kmltkc.de/leanlearning/place/40_shaped_vs_scattered_learning.html</link>

      <description>Learning can take place in two ways - planned and random. Both are relevant and should be included in every learning journey. Planned learning, or as it is called in LeLe, shaped learning is about collecting materials and assembling them into a learning unit. You can even shape multiple learnings and intentionally decide what to focus on and what to ignore. This makes shaped learning very time-intensive and deliberate.&#xA;But learning can also happen randomly.</description>

      <title>play as a portal to learning</title>

      <description>Most of us think of games when we hear playing. But playing is not just about games. Playing has important traits that can be used as a portal to learning. Playing helps you tap into focus and embrace frustration - two important learning components.&#xA;We played more when we were younger. We played and explored without overthinking. Everything was a huge experiment for us, and we tried, failed, and learned. But this changed while growing up.</description>

      <title>prime by making a M.E.S.S.</title>
      <link>https://kmltkc.de/leanlearning/learning/50_priming_mess.html</link>

      <guid>https://kmltkc.de/leanlearning/learning/50_priming_mess.html</guid>
      <description>The goal of priming is to get an abstract and rough idea about a topic or concept. A big picture overview. It has to be abstract. Ignore the details otherwise you will get lost in them.&#xA;The idea is to start thinking, start having questions and awaken your curiosity. The LeLe method allows you to prime by making a M.E.S.S. - map, explore, skim and self-explain.&#xA;map Map out your thoughts.</description>

      <title>the power of pause</title>
      <link>https://kmltkc.de/leanlearning/mindset/60_power_of_pause.html</link>

      <guid>https://kmltkc.de/leanlearning/mindset/60_power_of_pause.html</guid>
      <description>Until now, we have emphasised the importance of focusing and embracing frustration. But learning has two stages. One of them is focus and frustration. The other one is rest. Resting is important for learning.&#xA;Learning is associated with changes in your brain. But the changes in your brain actually don’t happen while studying. They happen at rest.&#xA;The focus and frustration stage is just a highlighter. Neurotransmitters are released during learning just to highlight areas in your brain relevant to what you are trying to learn.</description>

      <title>S.I.M.P. method for learning</title>
      <link>https://kmltkc.de/leanlearning/learning/60_learning_simp.html</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 20 Dec 2023 12:17:22 +0100</pubDate>
      <guid>https://kmltkc.de/leanlearning/learning/60_learning_simp.html</guid>
      <description>The next phase of learning, after priming and before practicing, is studying. For this we can use the S.I.M.P. method. This method also incorporates the iterative mapping approach from before.&#xA;The S.I.M.P. method stands for&#xA;self-explaining iterating mapping pausing and all of them should be used while studying.&#xA;self-explain Self-explain what you are trying to learn. Skim, read or watch the learning content. But rather than transcribing what you consume, explain it to yourself.</description>

      <title>practice makes perfect</title>
      <link>https://kmltkc.de/leanlearning/learning/70_practice_perfect.html</link>

      <guid>https://kmltkc.de/leanlearning/learning/70_practice_perfect.html</guid>
      <description>After priming and studying, the final phase of learning is practising. Through practice and repetition, we can internalise what we are learning and build expertise and knowledge. Practice makes perfect.&#xA;But how should we practice? It really depends on what you are trying to learn. Most of the time you will hear advice like &amp;ldquo;learn by building a project&amp;rdquo; which is good advice. The LeLe method recommends it too. But not everything we learn can be connected to a project.</description>
