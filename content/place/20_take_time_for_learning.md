After having a place to learn, we now need to find the time to learn. Or more
accurately, we have to take the time to learn. We may avoid learning by letting
random tasks creep into our schedule. We might also hope that magically a time
slot will appear in which we can learn. We don't plan for it. We let it to
chance. And finally, we get annoyed because we never find the time to learn.

Therefore, here are a few strategies to hopefully help you take the time to
learn.

## the obvious one again: reduce distractions

Reduce distractions so that you can have control over your own time. Instead of
distractions chipping away precious time from you.

## design your day

What helped me the most was not following random advice like "learn in the
morning". It never works because our lives and personalities are just too
different. Learning has to fit into your schedule.

Thus the goal is to think about the best time to learn. Be it in the morning,
afternoon or evening. Block that time to prioritize learning.

Ask yourself:

- Are you a night owl or a morning bird?
- What does your day look like?
- When do you have time and energy to focus and learn?

If you find possible time slots, block them for learning. They can also be
flexible because life constantly throws unexpected problems at us. Maybe learn
in the morning between 8-11 for 2 one hour sessions. This way if something
comes up randomly you don't sacrifice learning. You just move it a bit.

## make learning a highlight

And finally, make learning a highlight of your day. Too often we fill up our
day with random small tasks or we plan on doing too many big and important
things. Both of which steal time away from what matters to us: learning.

While planning your day, make learning a highlight. Ideally, you plan your day
the night before or first thing in the morning. Have one highlight, two
important tasks and the rest are necessary or random small tasks you have to
do.

Having learning defined as a highlight will increase the likelihood of you
actually doing it. Your highlight will make you feel great at the end of the
day.

Now after having a place to learn and taking the time to learn, it is time to
plan your learning.
