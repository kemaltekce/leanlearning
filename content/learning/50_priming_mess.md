The goal of **priming** is to get an abstract and rough idea about a topic. A
big picture overview. It has to be abstract. Ignore the details otherwise you
will get lost in them.

The idea is to get your mind thinking, start having questions and awaken your
curiosity. The LeLe method allows you to prime by making a M.E.S.S. - map,
explore, skim and self-explain.

## map

Map out your thoughts. Map by making a list first, with key concepts and ideas.
Afterwards, connect them together into a mindmap. Make it abstract and simple.

Keep in mind that you won't get everything right immediately. And you don't
have to. Getting it right the first time is not the goal. It's a new topic, so
mistakes and misunderstandings will happen. Later while studying, in the next
phase, you will have plenty of time to correct your mindmap. But for now, just
start thinking and get familiar with the topic. Start getting an idea of how
big concepts might be connected together or contrasted against each other.

## explore and skim

To get the relevant information, ideas and concepts you have to explore your
materials. Skim them, make a list of most important concepts and map them into
a mindmap.

## self explain

While skimming and mapping, it is important that you don't transcribe blindly.
Try to make sense of it yourself. Explain what you are learning to yourself.
Even if it is wrong at first.

Try to answer the questions like:

- Why is it important?
- Is it even important or can it be ignored for now?
- How might it be connected or contrasted to other ideas and concepts?
- What is it exactly? Evaluate and rephrase in your own words.

By following this M.E.S.S. you will get an abstract understanding of what you
want to learn. Connections and questions will emerge which will guide your
learning. They even will awaken your curiosity and give you the motivation to
learn. Our brain hates open questions and needs answers.
