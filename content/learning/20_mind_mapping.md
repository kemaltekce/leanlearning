The foundational learning technique of LeLe is mind mapping. It is used in all
three phases of learning - priming, studying and even practising if you are
trying to learn information. But how do we mind map?

## define focus question

Start your mind map by defining a focus question. A question you want to answer
inside your mind map. Depending on your questions your mind map might look
different. Additionally, a focus question can help you focus on something
specific and avoid bigger detours into different areas and topics. Defining a
focus question enables you to aim at a goal.

To get the most out of mind mapping, there are certain components you can use,
and there are also certain elements to avoid. Otherwise, your mind map will get
too messy and impractical.

## components of a map

Here is a list of **components** you can use in your mind maps:

- text with different styles
- arrows with different styles
- different shapes
- different colors
- doodles
- visual metaphors
- images

Use them however you want, as long as they support your thinking and learning.
Use different styles to highlight different relationships or to emphasise
certain connections.

## stuff to avoid

In contrast to components to use, there are also things you should **avoid**
while mind mapping:

- long chains of notes
- spokes of notes
- being too wordy
- transcribing

Long chains or spokes of notes are often not meaningful enough to support your
learning. The same is also true for notes that are too wordy or even
transcribed. You have to take notes in your own words. Your mind map has to
reflect your thinking. If it's too wordy, you might get lost in too many
details. Try to make meaningful connections and group your notes together to
refine your mind map. Try taking notes while self-explaining the content.

## the 4C rules of mind mapping

Besides what to use and what to avoid, there are also four rules to follow
while mind mapping: create, compare, connect and compress:

**Create**: create a map of your mind. Self-explain what you are trying to
learn. Map your thoughts and current understanding. This helps with spotting
gaps, questions and misunderstandings.

**Compare**: compare concepts and insights. This supports higher-order learning
according to Blooms Taxonomy (which are: create, evaluate, analyse, apply,
understand, remember)

**Connect**: connect concepts and insights. This helps build a network.
Relevant relationships will help you understand and retrieve the information
later when you need it.

**Compress**: simplify by grouping. If your mind map gets messy, take a moment
to refine and simplify it. Group similar information together to compress your
notes. This will make your mind map cleaner and less cluttered.

After learning more about mind mapping and the three phases of learning, it's
time to combine both into iterative learning.
