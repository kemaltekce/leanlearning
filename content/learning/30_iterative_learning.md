Learning is not about sitting down and studying once. Learning is not about
understanding it perfectly immediately. Learning is about constant iteration.
You build up your understanding step by step correcting your mistakes and
misunderstandings along the way.

Iterative learning so powerful because learning is recursive and excursive.
Recursive meaning: you have to rethink, re-understanding and re-practice to
find gaps and questions in your understanding. Excursive because your learning
journey is not the same as someone else's. You have another set of preknowledge
which helps or even hinders your understanding of new concepts.

Thus, the main idea of LeLe is to combine iterative learning and mind mapping
into **iterative mind mapping**. This combined approach also connects all three
phases of learning - priming, studying and practising - together.

## how to iterate

You start with an empty canvas. Iterate from rough concepts to detailed
insights, from the big picture to fine details. Map out your understanding as
you learn. Each iteration can add another level of detail and complexity to
your understanding and mind map.

Practically this means, start iterating by priming first - skim the material
and express your thoughts on your mind map. Make a list of key concepts and
insights while you skim. After that, use the list and create a simple mind map.
The mind map should reflect how the concepts might be connected and related to
each other. Follow the 4C rules while mapping.

After priming, start studying. Gaps, questions and misunderstandings will
bubble up. Use them as guidance and go into more detail. Adjust and add to your
mind map as you study.

If the time is right, practice. Either by applying or by actively recalling
what you learnt until now. Through practice, you will again discover more
questions and gaps in your understanding.

From here iterate. Prime, study, practice. Iterate on your mind map. Go into
more detail with each step. But try to build up each branch of your map
equally. Don't overfocus on one branch. Otherwise, it will be too detailed
compared to others and important relationships might get lost.

If you have details that you can't ignore, put them aside or create separate
notes for them. These separate notes can then be linked to as references from
your mind map.

Simplified, the iteration looks like this:

- skim, read, watch
- create a list
- map out your understanding
- connect, chunk, contrast
- refine, simplify, group
- practice and discover questions and misunderstandings

Keep in mind, your mind map is what you think. It will not be perfect or even
correct at first. But it's just the starting point. Each iteration will refine
your mind map. Refine your understanding.

Hopefully, this iterative approach helps you mind map and learn. Next, we will
go into more detail with regard to priming, studying and practising.
