The next phase of learning is studying and for this we can use the S.I.M.P.
method. This also incorporates the iterative mapping approach from before.

The S.I.M.P. method stands for

- self-explaining
- iterating
- mapping
- pausing

and all of them should be used while studying.

## self-explain

**Self-explain** what you are trying to learn. Skim, read, or watch what you
are trying to learn. But rather than transcribing what you consume, explain it
to yourself. This way you reflect what is in your mind. You phrase it in your
own words. This helps with spotting gaps, questions and misunderstandings. It's
more effective than just blindly transcribing notes.

Self-explaining also combines a lot of other effective learning methods like
recall and interleaving. While you self-explain you recall and try to remember
what you just read. Additionally, you can self-explain the concepts and
insights from different perspectives which means you are interleaving.

All in all, self-explaining tests your understanding while you learn.

## iterate and map

Next, you should also **iterate** and **map** while studying. Use the iterative
and the mind mapping method we discussed before. You basically map out your
understanding while studying and self-explaining. But do it in an iterative
approach from a rough understanding to a more detailed understanding.

Keep iterating and mapping. Follow gaps, questions or misunderstandings that
bubble up. Use them as guidance and go into more detail by following the same
steps:

- skim, read, watch
- create a list
- map out your understanding
- connect, chunk, contrast
- refine, simplify, group

To keep your mind map clean and comprehensible, put bigger details or grouped
notes aside. You can also create separate notes for them and reference them
from your mind map if necessary.

## pause

Finally, we should also make use of the "power of **pause**" (see text in the
first chapter). Be it by using micro rests while studying or deep rests after a
study session. The pause helps you think and reflect. Let it sink in before
jumping to the next topic, task or distraction.
