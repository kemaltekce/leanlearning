The next phase of learning, after priming and before practicing, is studying.
For this we can use the S.I.M.P. method. This method also incorporates the
iterative mapping approach from before.

The S.I.M.P. method stands for

- self-explaining
- iterating
- mapping
- pausing

and all of them should be used while studying.

## self-explain

**Self-explain** what you are trying to learn. Skim, read or watch the learning
content. But rather than transcribing what you consume, explain it to yourself.
Explain it in your own words. This way you reflect and express what's in your
mind. You phrase it in your own words. You actively think about it. This helps
with spotting gaps, questions and misunderstandings. It's more effective than
just blindly transcribing notes.

Self-explaining also combines a lot of other effective learning methods like
recall and interleaving. While you self-explain you recall and try to remember
what you just read. Additionally, you can self-explain the concepts and
insights from different perspectives which means you are interleaving.

All in all, self-explaining tests your understanding while you learn.

## iterate and map

Next, you should also **iterate** and **map** while studying. Use the iterative
mind mapping method we discussed before. You basically map out your
understanding while studying and self-explaining. But do it in an iterative
approach from a rough understanding to a more detailed understanding.

Keep iterating. Keep mapping. Follow gaps, questions or misunderstandings that
bubble up. Use them as guidance and go into more detail by following the same
steps:

- skim, read, watch
- create a list
- map out your understanding
- connect, chunk, contrast
- refine, simplify, group

To keep your mind map clean and comprehensible, put bigger details and grouped
notes aside. Put them aside and reference them or link to them from your
mindmap.

## pause

Finally, we should also make use of the "power of **pause**" (see article in
the first chapter). Be it by using micro rests while studying or deep rests
after a study session. The pause helps you think and reflect. Let it sink in
before jumping to the next topic, task or distraction.
