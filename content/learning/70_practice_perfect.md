After priming and studying, the final phase of learning is practising. Through
practice and repetition, we can internalise what we are learning and build
expertise and knowledge. Practice makes perfect.

But how should we practice?

It really depends on what you are trying to learn. Most of the time you will
hear advice like "learn by building a project" which is good advice. The LeLe
method recommends it too. But not everything we learn can be connected to a
project.

Learning goals like learning "the basics of how the brain works" are heavily
information-based and can't really be applied in a project.

Therefore the LeLe method divides practising into two categories:

- practising skills via project
- practising information via testing

Projects can be used as practice if you are trying to learn skills like coding.
While planning your learning, define a project you want to work on. Study the
basic (like the basic coding syntax) with the S.I.M.P. method from online
content like documentation, articles or tutorials. After that, start applying
what you studied in your project. Let struggles and problems during your
project guide your learning. This way you always iterate between study and
practice.

If, on the other hand, you want to learn something information-heavy which
can't really be applied in a project, use testing as practice. Ideally
something like interleaved recall. After a study session, practice and test
yourself. Get an empty canvas and put your actual map to the side. Map out your
understanding - which is the recall part. Try to explain it from different
perspectives or paths - which is the interleaving part. Naturally, you will
discover gaps in your understanding, make mistakes or come across questions.
Like before, use these struggles and problems to guide your learning. Study
those areas to bridge the gap and practice again.

Iterating between study and practice will deepen your understanding and build
expertise.
