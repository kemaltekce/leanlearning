Learning can be annoying. It can get frustrating trying to understand a concept
or there might be too many interesting topics to learn or you can even fall
into the trap of shallow learning - keeping yourself entertained without
actually learning anything.

To solve these problems, the LeLe method aims to make learning intentional,
enjoyable and forgiving.

## intentional

It makes learning intentional so that you can find the time to learn and focus
on what you want to learn. To achieve this, one goal is to constrain your
curiosities so that you are not dragged around from one interesting topic to
the next. In LeLe you plan "learnings" (learning units) by defining what and
why you want to learn. Additionally, you intentionally decide between your
planned learnings what you actually want to learn.

## enjoyable

It makes learning enjoyable by making it as simple as possible but not simpler.
You don't need a complex fancy learning system. A simple one will do the job.
Often we waste a lot of time searching for the perfect system and random
learning hacks, which never work. LeLe will provide you with a simple learning
system and a simple set of learning methods. You can use them as a toolkit.
Pick the ones you like. Add things that are missing for your ideal workflow.

We can simplify the learning system but we can't simplify learning itself by
getting rid of mistakes, confusion or frustration. They are actually part of
learning and should be embraced. Don't avoid them.

## forgiving

Finally, LeLe aims to make learning forgiving because learning can be
emotionally charged. As mentioned before, learning has to be confusing and
frustrating at some level but you should never beat yourself up emotionally
because of it.

Finding the motivation and energy to learn is also difficult. Often just
starting helps to boost your motivation and energy. But if it doesn't, maybe
you really need a break to recharge.

Additionally, you might start a learning journey, only to realize that it
wasn't right. It was a fake curiosity. LeLe gives you the room to explore and
forget if necessary. It treats learning as small experiments and experiments
are allowed to fail.

To help with all this, LeLe has three components - mindset, place, and
learning.
