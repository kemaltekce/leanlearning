Learning helps you expand your knowledge, follow your curiosities and adapt to
new circumstances. But learning takes time and effort. During school and
university, it was easier to learn. You had time. You had a curriculum to
follow. You had deadlines for tests. Everything was prepared for you.

But it's more difficult to learn while you are working or if you want to learn
something new on the side.

The desire and curiosity to learn are there but you might only have limited
time during the day.

You might also have different interests and topics you want to learn about.
And, you can even find endless content for almost everything. But which
interest, topic or content should you choose? How should you decide?

Is it a real curiosity or just a fake one? Is your ego tricking you to believe
that you have to learn this specific topic?

Even if you find the time, the topic and the content to learn with, how are you
going to actually learn? Which learning methods will support your learning the
best? And how do you want to make use of the new skill or knowledge?

I felt this way for a long time now. All these questions kept and still keep
bothering me. I'm eager to learn but learning doesn't feel great anymore.

My curiosity was pulling me all over the place. I started reading a lot of
different books and watching a variety of online lectures. I even tried
multiple iterations of the Zettelkasten method. And it felt great for a while.
Until it didn't.

To overcome this hurdle of learning - finding time and content, constraining
your curiosity, and making learning joyful and effective - I created the LeLe
method. The lean learning method.
