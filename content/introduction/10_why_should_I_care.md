Learning helps you expand your knowledge, follow your curiosities and adapt to
new circumstances. But learning takes time and effort. During school and
university, it was easier to learn. You had time. You had a curriculum to
follow. You had deadlines for tests. Everything was prepared for you.

But it's more difficult to learn while you are working.

You might want to learn about philosophy after work. You might want to improve
your communication and writing skills. Or, you might want to learn to code.

The desire and curiosity to learn are there but between work, parenting or
other responsibilities you only have limited time during the day.

Additionally, you might also have different interests and topics you want to
learn about. Your curiosity might be pulling you all over the place, which
makes deciding and finding time even more difficult.

Even if you find the time, the topic and the content to learn with, how are you
going to actually learn? Which learning methods will support your learning the
best? And how do you want to make use of the new skill or knowledge?

I felt this way for a long time now. All these questions kept and still keep
bothering me. I'm eager to learn but learning doesn't feel great anymore.

My curiosity was pulling me all over the place. I started reading a lot of
different books and watching a variety of online lectures. I even tried
multiple iterations of the Zettelkasten method. And it felt great for a while.
Until it didn't.

To overcome this hurdle of learning - finding time and content, constraining
your curiosity, and making learning joyful and effective - I created the LeLe
method. The lean learning method.

The LeLe method is a guide on how to learn. It's also a toolkit full of
techniques from which you can pick, adapt and use in your own learning process.
