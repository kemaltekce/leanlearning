The LeLe method is inspired by a variety of ideas and people from the space of
productivity and neuroscience. LeLe tries to combine those diverse ideas into
one coherent learning framework.

So, special thanks go out to Ryan Carroll and Bullet Journal Method, Andrew
Hubermann and the Hubermann Lab Podcast, Justin Sung and his insights into
learning and Ryan Singer and his Shape Up method.

The Bullet Journal Method inspired the LeLe method to be intentional and less
distracting. It helps to constrain curiosities.

The Hubermann Podcast provided insights into how learning happens
neurochemically and which methods can support learning effectively.

The learning techniques in LeLe, like mind mapping and higher-order learning,
are inspired by Justin Sung's content.

And finally, ideas from the Shape Up method help plan your learning.

I tried to combine all of their ideas and insights with my personal experience
to create a learning method that could help me enjoy learning again. And maybe
it will help you too.
