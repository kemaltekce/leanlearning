Until now, we have emphasised the importance of focusing and embracing
frustration. But learning has two stages. One of them is focus and frustration.
The other one is rest. Resting is important for learning.

Learning is associated with changes in your brain. But the changes in your
brain actually don't happen while you are learning. They happen at rest.

The focus and frustration stage is just a highlighter. Neurotransmitters
released during learning just highlight areas in your brain which are relevant
to what you are learning. They mark places for possible change. The actual
changes, then, happen during rest which is the power of pause.

During rest, a replay happens of what you tried to learn and alongside that
changes to the brain's wiring are made.

Here are a few methods from Andrew Hubermann to incorporate rest into your
learning routine.

## #1 During study - micro resting

During your study, you can do micro resting. Randomly, while you are studying,
just pause for 10 seconds. Eyes open or closed. Just be where you are, pause
and continue studying afterwards. According to Hubermann, research has shown a
positive effect of these micro rests during studying. You can do this multiple
times while you are learning.

## #2 After study - deep rest

Another method is to rest after you studied. Every 60-90 minutes of studying
can be followed up by a 10-15 minute deep rest routine. No phone, no TV, no
chores. Just rest.

## #3 At night - sleep

And the final and most obvious method to rest is at night with a good night's
sleep.
