Until now, we have emphasised the importance of focusing and embracing
frustration. But learning has two stages. One of them is focus and frustration.
The other one is rest. Resting is important for learning.

Learning is associated with changes in your brain. But the changes in your
brain actually don’t happen while studying. They happen at rest.

The focus and frustration stage is just a highlighter. Neurotransmitters are
released during learning just to highlight areas in your brain relevant to what
you are trying to learn. They mark places for possible change. However, the
actual changes happen during rest. This is the power of pause.

During rest, a replay happens of what you tried to learn. Alongside this
replay, changes are being made to your brain’s wiring. These changes are
associated with learning.

Here are a few methods from Andrew Hubermann to incorporate rest into your
learning routine.

## #1 During study — micro resting

During your study, you can do micro resting. Randomly, while you are studying,
just pause for 10 seconds. Eyes open or closed. Just be where you are, pause
and continue studying afterwards. According to Hubermann, research has shown a
positive effect of these micro rests during studying. You can do this multiple
times while you are learning.

## #2 After study — deep rest

Another method is to rest after you studied. Every 60–90 minutes of studying
can be followed up by a 10–15 minute deep rest routine. No phone, no TV, no
chores. Just rest.

## #3 At night — sleep

The final and most obvious method to rest is at night with a good night’s
sleep.

Try implementing these resting routines to unlock the power of pause.
