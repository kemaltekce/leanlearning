The flow state is a place where things feel effortless. You know exactly what
to do and you can do it. So we often expect learning to be the same. But
learning almost never feels effortless. You have to explore, try to understand
and rethink concepts all the time. And, most importantly, you will make
mistakes. All of which is frustrating.

Learning is challenging. Learning is frustrating. And sadly there is no hack.

But frustration has a bad reputation. Once we feel frustrated, we stop
learning. We donâ€™t understand. We start making mistakes. We quit. But actually,
this feeling of frustration is the perfect cue to keep learning, not to stop
learning.

You feel frustrated because you challenge yourself and your understanding. You
reach a critical point full of questions and almost no answers. Wrangling to
come up with a solid understanding. This is a crucial part of learning.

As mentioned in the previous part, focus and frustration will trigger a bunch
of neurochemicals needed for learning - epinephrine, acetylcholine and
dopamine. Don't let this neurochemical cocktail go to waste.

Stopping to learn when you are frustrated will not only waste these
neurochemicals but they will also reinforce the bad habit of giving up. Making
it more likely to give up the next time when things get frustrating.

Therefore, don't abandon learning. Don't run away. Stay with the frustration a
bit longer. Give your brain the chance to figure things out and reward trying
despite the frustration. Even if you can't figure things out completely, try
coming up with the best understanding you can and sticking to learning.

Learning is supposed to be frustrating.
