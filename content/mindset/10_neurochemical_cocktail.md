Learning happens in a state of focus and being comfortable with frustration.
This duo triggers the neurochemical cocktail needed for learning which consists
of Acetylcholine, Epinephrine and Dopamine.

But how are these neuromodulators connected to focus and frustration?

Focusing means paying attention and being alert at the same time. Paying
attention releases Acetylcholine which helps with your focus. Being alert, on
the other hand, releases Epinephrine which reduces anxiety and gives you the
energy to learn.

To support your focus and the release of Acetylcholine, define what you want to
learn and why you want to learn it. Additionally, use focusing techniques like
timeboxing - dedicating a specific time interval to learning - or visual
focusing - focusing visually helps focusing mentally.

If you can't get yourself to start and focus because of stress, anxiety or
feeling lazy, reduce the emotional burden by simply just starting small
enough - reading just one sentence, writing just one note or learning just for
one minute. It might be all you need to trigger your curiosity and motivation.

On the other hand, Epinephrine is released to wake up your brain. It tells the
neurons to be ready. To support the release of Epinephrine you can prioritise
your sleep, drink some coffee in the morning, move a bit or use breathing
exercises. Like before, it also helps to have good reasons to learn. All these
will increase your energy level.

And the last ingredient - Dopamine - will come into play once we start making
mistakes. While learning we will naturally make mistakes. It will get
frustrating. But, instead of running away, try to stay and correct those
mistakes. Try to get it right. Try to come closer to understanding. Even if you
don't accomplish it. The effort will pay out. The effort you put into it is not
for nothing. It might feel that way but Dopamine works in a mysterious way.
Dopamine will still reward your learning and help you keep going. Frustration
and Dopamine are crucial for learning.

Learning happens in a state where this neurochemical trio of Acetylcholine,
Epinephrine and Dopamine work together. Therefore, try to focus and get
comfortable with frustration while learning.

Next, we will talk about specific methods to focus and get comfortable with
frustration.
